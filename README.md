# E-commerce Web Site

I created a e-commerce site. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS.<br>

As stated in the design, I added the products to my project via API. Then I separated them according to their categories.
When we added the products to the cart, I was able to make more than one selection along with the quantity information. Finally, I showed the amount of the selected products dynamically in the total section.
